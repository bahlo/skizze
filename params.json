Analysis of such large data sets often requires powerful distributed data stores like Hadoop and heavy data processing with techniques like MapReduce. This approach often leads to heavyweight high-latency analytical processes and poor applicability to realtime use cases. On the other hand, when one is interested only in simple additive metrics like total page views or average price of conversion, it is obvious that raw data can be efficiently summarized, for example, on a daily basis or using simple in-stream counters.  Computation of more advanced metrics like a number of unique visitor or most frequent items is more challenging and requires a lot of resources if implemented straightforwardly.\r\n\r\nSkizze is a (fire and forget) service that provides a probabilistic data structures (sketches) storage that allows estimation of these and many other metrics, with a trade off in precision of the estimations for the memory consumption. These data structures can be used both as temporary data accumulators in query processing procedures and, perhaps more important, as a compact – sometimes astonishingly compact – replacement of raw data in stream-based computing.\r\n\r\n## Example use cases (queries)?\r\n* How many distinct elements are in the data set (i.e. what is the cardinality of the data set)?\r\n* What are the most frequent elements (the terms “heavy hitters” and “top-k elements” are also used)?\r\n* What are the frequencies of the most frequent elements?\r\n* How many elements belong to the specified range (range query, in SQL it looks like `SELECT count(v) WHERE v >= c1 AND v < c2)?`\r\n* Does the data set contain a particular element (membership query)?\r\n\r\n## How to build and install\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake dist\r\n./bin/skizze\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/skizze-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Create** a new Domain (Collection of Sketches):\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n#CREATE DOM $name $estCardinality $topk\r\nCREATE DOM demostream 10000000 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Add** values to the domain:\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n#ADD DOM $name $value1, $value2 ....\r\nADD DOM demostream zod joker grod zod zod grod\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Get** the *cardinality* of the domain:\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n# GET CARD $name\r\nGET CARD demostream\r\n\r\n# returns:\r\n# Cardinality: 9\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Get** the *rankings* of the domain:\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n# GET RANK $name\r\nGET RANK demostream\r\n\r\n# returns:\r\n# Rank: 1\t  Value: zod\t  Hits: 3\r\n# Rank: 2\t  Value: grod\t  Hits: 2\r\n# Rank: 3\t  Value: joker\t  Hits: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Get** the *frequencies* of values in the domain:\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n# GET FREQ $name $value1 $value2 ...\r\nGET FREQ demostream zod joker batman grod\r\n\r\n# returns\r\n# Value: zod\t  Hits: 3\r\n# Value: joker\t  Hits: 1\r\n# Value: batman\t  Hits: 0\r\n# Value: grod\t  Hits: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Get** the *membership* of values in the domain:\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n# GET MEMB $name $value1 $value2 ...\r\nGET MEMB demostream zod joker batman grod\r\n\r\n# returns\r\n# Value: zod\t  Member: true\r\n# Value: joker\t  Member: true\r\n# Value: batman\t  Member: false\r\n# Value: grod\t  Member: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**List** all available sketches (created by domains):\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\nLIST\r\n\r\n# returns\r\n# Name: demostream  Type: CARD\r\n# Name: demostream  Type: FREQ\r\n# Name: demostream  Type: MEMB\r\n# Name: demostream  Type: RANK\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Create** a new sketch of type $type (CARD, MEMB, FREQ or RANK):\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n# CREATE CARD $name\r\nCREATE CARD demosketch\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Add** values to the sketch of type $type (CARD, MEMB, FREQ or RANK):\r\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\r\n#ADD $type $name $value1, $value2 ....\r\nADD CARD demostream zod joker grod zod zod grod\r\n```\r\n\r\n## In Progress:\r\n### More REPL\r\n* [x] Redesign data-structures main interface\r\n* [x] Add new domains model\r\n* [x] Add snapshotting\r\n* [ ] Add AOF\r\n* [x] Add gRPC API\r\n* [x] Add REPL\r\n  * [x] DELETE DOM $name \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# delete domain and all its sketches\r\n  * [x] DELETE $type $name \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# delete a sketch of $type CARD, MEMB, FREQ, RANK and $name\r\n  * [x] LIST DOM \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# list all domains\r\n  * [x] SAVE \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# Explicityly save state of all domains and sketches\r\n* [ ] New Docs\r\n* [x] Clean up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nSkizze is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n- [Seif Lotfy](https://twitter.com/seiflotfy)\r\n- [Neil Jagdish Patel](https://twitter.com/njpatel)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
